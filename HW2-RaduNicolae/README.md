## Exercises

### 1. List Activity Example

  Create an Android application that has a **ListActivity** with a static list of four elements: Apple, LG, Samsung and Sony.
  
### 2. Programatical List Activity (Dynamic list)

  Based on the project created at the first exercise, create a new application that will display the same elements generated from an array that is defined inside the Activity.
  
### 3. Custom List Application

  Modify the previous application so that each element from the list will contain an image with the logo, followed by the text.

### 4. Logged List Application

  Modify the previous application so that each function from the **Adapter** contains a Log.d call. The purpose of this modification is to better understand the flow of Adapters.

### 5. List Activity improved

  Modify the previous application by adding a new **EditText** and a **Button** through which the user is able to input a new element in the list. The application will display the new element in the list with a _default picture_.
  
### 6. List Intented Application :) 

  Modify the previous application so that when an item is clicked, a **new Activity** will open that will display the information that is stored for that element. For the initially predefined elements (Apple, LG, Samsung and Sony), you will also display a short description of the company. For the others, you will display just the list item in a **TextView** and the logo in an **ImageView**.

>Note 1: You can choose either Java or Kotlin in order to solve the exercises.

>Note 2: For each independent project that will be created, create a separate folder in your repository that will contain the code (e.q. App1 and App2)

>Note 3: Do not forget to make a push with the changes after each exercise.
